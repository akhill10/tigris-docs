# Vector Search

Tigris allows you to store vector embeddings in a search index for fast and scalable vector search.
Vector search is a powerful technique that can be used for building semantic search
applications, recommendation engines, and more.

## Creating a Search Index

Let's say we have a Search Index `reviews` with following schema:

```ts
@TigrisSearchIndex("reviews")
export class Review {
  @SearchField(TigrisDataTypes.INT64)
  Id: string;

  @SearchField({ sort: true, facet: true })
  ProductId: string;

  @SearchField()
  UserId: string;

  @SearchField(TigrisDataTypes.INT64, { sort: true, facet: true })
  Score: number;

  @SearchField(TigrisDataTypes.INT64, { sort: true })
  Time: number;

  @SearchField()
  Summary: string;

  @SearchField()
  Text: string;

  // 1536 floats total for ada-002
  @SearchField({ dimensions: 1536 })
  vector: number[];
}
```

This search index can be created as following:

```ts
const tigrisClient = new Tigris();
const search = tigrisClient.getSearch();
await search.createOrUpdateIndex(Review);
```

Here the field `vector` stores the 1536-dimensional vector embedding. The vector embeddings can be generated
using the OpenAPI Embeddings API.

## Generating Vector Embeddings

The next step is to generate vector embeddings for the documents to be stored in the search index.

Below is sample code for generating vector embeddings using the OpenAI Embeddings API:

```ts
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";

const MODEL = "text-embedding-ada-002";

const getOpenaiClient = (): OpenAIApi => {
  // setup OpenAI client
  const config = new Configuration({
    organization: process.env.OPENAI_ORG,
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  });
  return new OpenAIApi(config);
};

const createEmbedding = async (
  openai: OpenAIApi,
  input: string
): Promise<number[]> => {
  const embeddings = await openai.createEmbedding({
    model: MODEL,
    input: input,
  });
  return embeddings.data.data[0]?.embedding;
};
```

## Performing Vector Search

Assuming that the search index has been populated with data, we can now perform vector search.

Similar to how we generated vector embeddings for the documents, we need to generate vector
embeddings for the search query. We can use the same code shown above to generate vector embeddings
for the input query.

Search consists of executing a query with these generated vector embeddings.

```ts
import { Search, SearchQuery } from "@tigrisdata/core";
import { Review } from "../search/models/review";

const index = await searchClient.getIndex<Review>("reviews");
const embeddings = await createEmbedding(openai, "hot sauce");

const request: SearchQuery<Review> = {
  vectorQuery: {
    vector: embeddings,
  },
  hitsPerPage: 5,
};

index.search(request).then((results) => {
  const docs = [];
  for (const hit of results.hits) {
    docs.push({
      Id: hit.document.Id,
      ProductId: hit.document.ProductId,
      UserId: hit.document.UserId,
      ProfileName: hit.document.ProfileName,
      Score: hit.document.Score,
      Summary: hit.document.Summary,
      Text: hit.document.Text,
      VectorDistance: hit.meta.textMatch.vectorDistance,
    });
  }
  console.log(docs);
});
```

We have searched for "hot sauce" and the results are sorted by the vector distance. The
vector distance is a measure of how similar the search string is to the review text. The
closer the vector distance is to 0, the more similar the review text is to the search
string.

Below is the output of the above code:

That is it! You have now successfully created a search index, populated it with data, and performed vector
search.

## Hyrbid Search

Hybrid search is a combination of vector search and attribute filtering.
By specifying expressions that filter on scalar fields you can narrow
down the results of a vector search making them more relevant.

Let's take the example of the vector search we performed above. We can
narrow down the results by filtering on the `Score` attribute.

```ts
const request: SearchQuery<Review> = {
  vectorQuery: {
    vector: embeddings,
  },
  filter: {
    score: {
      "$gt": 4,
    },
  },
  hitsPerPage: 5,
};

index.search(request).then((results) => {
  const docs = [];
  for (const hit of results.hits) {
    docs.push({
      Id: hit.document.Id,
      ProductId: hit.document.ProductId,
      UserId: hit.document.UserId,
      ProfileName: hit.document.ProfileName,
      Score: hit.document.Score,
      Summary: hit.document.Summary,
      Text: hit.document.Text,
      VectorDistance: hit.meta.textMatch.vectorDistance,
    });
  }
  console.log(docs);
});
```

Here we have filtered on the attribute `Score` so that the results from
the vector search query are only those reviews that have a score greater than 4.

The `filter` option can also be used to filter on multiple attributes.
For example if we want to filter on both `Score` and `ProductId` attributes,
we can do so as following:

```ts
const request: SearchQuery<Review> = {
  vectorQuery: {
    vector: embeddings,
  },
  filter: {
    "$and": [
      {
        ProductId: "B006F2NYI2",
      },
      {
        Score: {
          "$gt": 4,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  hitsPerPage: 5,
};

index.search(request).then((results) => {
  const docs = [];
  for (const hit of results.hits) {
    docs.push({
      Id: hit.document.Id,
      ProductId: hit.document.ProductId,
      UserId: hit.document.UserId,
      ProfileName: hit.document.ProfileName,
      Score: hit.document.Score,
      Summary: hit.document.Summary,
      Text: hit.document.Text,
      VectorDistance: hit.meta.textMatch.vectorDistance,
    });
  }
  console.log(docs);
});
```
