# Delete Documents

Documents can be deleted from a search index either using `id` field or a
filter that matches any number of documents.

### Get Search Index instance

<CodeBlock language="ts">{getSearchIndex}</CodeBlock>

## Delete a single document using `id`

Use `deleteOne` to delete an existing document using `id`. It returns a
DocStatus object that has error in case deletion fails, error would be
`undefined` if deletion succeeds.

```ts
const result = await catalog.deleteOne("407124e3-f4a9-4d72-b777-580d8f8de654");

console.log(result);
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
{
  "id": "407124e3-f4a9-4d72-b777-580d8f8de654"
}
```

</details>

## Delete multiple documents using `id`

Similar to deleteOne, `deleteMany()` can be used to delete multiple documents using id.

```ts
const result = await catalog.deleteMany([
  "002eeee4-4249-469d-9425-100fc0e60a68",
  "5659ff93-83fc-4355-8564-ac8efb47f4ef",
  "unknown-id",
]);

console.log(result);
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
[
  {
    "id": "002eeee4-4249-469d-9425-100fc0e60a68"
  },
  {
    "id": "5659ff93-83fc-4355-8564-ac8efb47f4ef"
  }
  {
    "id": "unknown-id",
    "error": {
      "errMsg": "TigrisError: Could not find a document with id: unknown-id"
    }
  }
]
```

</details>

## Delete multiple documents matching a filter

Alternatively, you can use the [filters as used in search()](../search/#filters) to select a subset
of documents for deletion. This `deleteByQuery()` method returns a number of deleted documents.

#### Example: delete documents by filtering for documents matching a `brand`

```ts
const deleteCount = await catalog.deleteByQuery({ brand: "coach" });
```

#### Example: delete documents matching a more complex filtering condition

```ts
const deleteCount = await catalog.deleteByQuery({
  "$and": [
    {
      price: {
        "$gte": 35,
      },
    },
    {
      price: {
        "$lt": 90,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
