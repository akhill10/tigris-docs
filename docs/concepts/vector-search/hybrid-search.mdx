# Conduct a Hybrid Search

Hybrid search is a combination of vector search and attribute filtering.
By specifying expressions that filter on scalar fields you can narrow
down the results of a vector search making them more relevant.

The following example demonstrates how to perform a hybrid search.
Suppose you want to search for product reviews based on vector embeddings,
but you only want those for a certain product category. You can do this
by performing a vector search as usual, but this time also specifying a
filter expression that filters on the product category.

## Create an index

Index is where you store your documents and vector embeddings. An index has a
name and a schema.

```ts
// Define the index schema consisting of the document fields and vector field
@TigrisSearchIndex("reviews")
export class Review {
  @SearchField()
  Id: string;

  @SearchField()
  ProductCategory: string;

  @SearchField()
  Rating: number;

  @SearchField()
  Text: string;

  // 1536 floats total for ada-002
  @SearchField({ dimensions: 1536 })
  vector: number[];
}

// Create the index
const search = tigrisClient.getSearch();
await search.createOrUpdateIndex(Review);
```

## Add some documents to the index

Assuming you have already generated the vector embeddings, add the documents
with the embeddings to the index.

```ts
await index.createOrReplaceMany([
  {
    Id: "1",
    Text: "This is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    ProductCategory: "Electronics",
    Rating: 5,
    vector: [1.2, 2.3, 4.5],
  },
  {
    Id: "2",
    Text: "This is a bad product. I would not recommend it to anyone.",
    ProductCategory: "Books",
    Rating: 1,
    vector: [6.7, 8.2, 9.2],
  },
  {
    Id: "3",
    Text: "This is a good product. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    ProductCategory: "Electronics",
    Rating: 4,
    vector: [1.0, 2.1, 3.2],
  },
]);
```

## Perform a hybrid search

Now we can query the index for similar documents by providing the query
vector. But we will limit the search results to documents that have a
product category of "Electronics".

```ts
const request: SearchQuery<Review> = {
  vectorQuery: {
    vector: [1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
  },
  filter: {
    ProductCategory: "Electronics",
  },
  hitsPerPage: 10,
};

index.search(request).then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

Here the `filter` option is used to specify the attribute filtering
expression. The `filter` option is an object where the keys are the
attributes in the documents and the values are the values to filter on.

The `filter` option can also be used to filter on multiple attributes.
For example, if you wanted to filter on both the product category and
the rating, you could do the following:

```ts
const request: SearchQuery<Review> = {
  vectorQuery: {
    vector: [1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
  },
  filter: {
    $and: [
      {
        ProductCategory: "Electronics",
      },
      {
        Rating: {
          $gt: 4,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  hitsPerPage: 10,
};

index.search(request).then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```
